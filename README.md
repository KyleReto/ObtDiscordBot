# Obt

Dangerous Space Squad's Discord Bot

To run the bot:
Install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/

Open the command line in the Obt folder (shift right click in file explorer, open command prompt)

Install nodemon (type 'npm i -g nodemon' into the command line opened above)

Run the bot by typing 'nodemon index.js' into that command line

The bot should be running now. Nodemon will automatically restart the bot when any of its files are changed, so you can get immediate feedback on your changes. Crashes and console.logs will appear in the command line.

Any changes should go into the index.js file (everything else is just node/discord.js things)

The documentation for discord.js is here: https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome.
